      "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we use it?\n",
      "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n",

      "\n",
      "Where does it come from?\n",
      "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n",

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n",

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

    "\n",
    "When working with files in Python, you can use various modes depending on what you want to do (read, write, append). Below are the most commonly used modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Read Mode (`r`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opens the file for **reading only**.\n",
    "* The file **must exist**, otherwise it raises a **FileNotFoundError**.\n",
    "* The file pointer is placed at the **beginning**.\n",

    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Write Mode (`w`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opens the file for **writing only**.\n",
    "* If the file already exists, it **truncates (deletes) the content**.\n",
    "* If the file does not exist, it **creates a new one**.\n",
    "* The file pointer is at the **beginning**.\n",

    "    f.write(\"New content\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Append Mode (`a`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opens the file for **appending new data** at the end.\n",
    "* Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "* The file pointer is at the **end**, so new data is added without removing existing content.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Opens the file for both **reading and writing**.\n",
    "* The file **must exist**, otherwise it raises a **FileNotFoundError**.\n",
    "* The file pointer is at the **beginning**.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.seek(offset, whence)\n",

    "  * `1`: Current file position.\n",
    "  * `2`: End of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move to the start:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.seek(0)  # Start of file\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.seek(0, 2)  # End of file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Move forward from the current position:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.seek(10, 1)  # 10 bytes forward from current\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Move backward from the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.seek(-5, 2)  # 5 bytes before the end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `f.tell()` to check the current file pointer position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    print(f.tell())  # Current position\n",
    "    f.seek(0, 2)     # Move to end\n",
    "    print(f.tell())  # End position\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose the appropriate mode (`r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`, `w+`, `a+`) based on your needs (read, write, append).\n",
    "* Be careful with modes that **truncate** the file (`w`, `w+`).\n",
